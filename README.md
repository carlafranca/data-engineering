### Iraj content

This repository is dedicated to a set of tools that I implemented
to support my courses I am teaching for Big Data Developer program.

It also includes some useful libraries that I may extract them in
future in different projects.

The content is published for public use on http://www.dataedu.ca

Note that I am not an experienced web developer and there would be
anti-patterns. Any help would be appreciated in that area.

Also, the site is for education and sharing purpose and funded
personally which I can't guarantee any SLA. However, I'd update
and improve it constantly.

If you have any suggestion, found any problem or feature request
that is useful to have, feel free to open an issue or get in touch
with me by email or through LinkedIn. It is not hard to find me.
